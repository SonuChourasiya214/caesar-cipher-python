Caesar Cipher – Python Project 🔐

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**
encryption and decryption technique using Python.

🔹 Features
- Encrypt text using a shift key
- Decrypt encrypted text
- Preserves numbers, spaces, and symbols
- Simple and beginner-friendly code
- Well-commented for easy understanding

🔹 How It Works
- Each letter is shifted forward or backward based on the key
- Uses modulo arithmetic to wrap around the alphabet

🔹 Usage
bash
python caesar_cipher.py
Example
Input: hello
Key: 3
Output: khoor

🔹 Concepts Used

Python functions

Loops and conditionals

String handling

Modulo arithmetic

🔹 Why This Project?

This project helps beginners understand classical encryption techniques
and strengthens Python fundamentals for cybersecurity learning.
